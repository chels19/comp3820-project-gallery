  We created the MediHealth application to solve problems that compromise clinical decision-making by means of real-time, tailored advice given to clinicians utilising clinical algorithms and expert systems, therefore optimising blood product prescription practices. By means of best practice recommendations based on haemoglobin levels, the program enables medical professionals to rapidly acquire required information at critical times, supporting them in making more accurate clinical judgments and thereby enhancing patient safety and treatment outcomes.
