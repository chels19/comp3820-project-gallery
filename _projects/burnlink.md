description: >
  BurnLink is a prototype developed to streamline clinician workflows and enable interoperability through FHIR with Electronic Health Record systems. Designed in collaboration with Dr. Jason Brown, BurnLink tackles challenges with unstructured referral data, converting it into structured FHIR resources. Phase 1 allows clinicians to import, manage, and export referrals efficiently. Future phases will enable secure API access and AI-driven clinical decision support through data-driven decisions. The main outcome of this project is to ensure improved clinician workflow and build the foundation for better patient outcomes.
