  Hello, we are team Fire Squad. This video showcases our SMART on FHIR application, designed to support self-monitoring for COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) patients. This video begins with a brief overview of the project background, including an introduction to COPD and the challenges it presents. We will also explain our design concept and technical approach, followed by a demo of the applicationâ€™s core features.
