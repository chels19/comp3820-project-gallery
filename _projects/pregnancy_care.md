  The problem statement here is the lack of data coordination between General Practitioners (GPs) and hospitals in pregnancy care. Currently information gathered in each setting is not easily exchanged, resulting in care and potential delays in making informed decisions. This leads to challenges of delivering pregnancy care which can impact both healthcare professionals and patients. The Pregnancy Care App project aims to provide a comprehensive platform supporting both patients and doctors. The app focuses on data visualization to help patients track their health and pregnancy progress while offering doctors the tools to monitor patientâ€™s , analyze, and provide better care.
