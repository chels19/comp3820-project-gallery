  This project develops an AI-driven SMART on FHIR application, enhancing the process to match patients with relevant clinical trials. We started by retrieving patient information using the FHIR standard from EPIC on FHIR platform. Next, the NCT IDs, trial description, inclusion and exclusion criteria are retrieved from ClinicalTrials.gov via API and converted to FHIR format. Lastly, we leveraged machine learning and deep learning technologies to score and rank the patients with the relevant clinical trials. The technologies used are Gemini.ai, TF-IDF and BERT. In conclusion, patients can find relevant clinical trials to participate in their clinical trials efficiently and effectively.
