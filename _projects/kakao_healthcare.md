  Our project, Kakao Healthcare, allows healthcare to manage patient data in the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) environment, including their BMI data and clinician notes. We also help them provide continuity of care by incorporating wearable data from the patient to fill gaps between clinic visits. Additionally, the website offers recommendations. It recommends ways for patients to have a healthier BMI and for clinicians to provide care for a certain patient, all based on the patient's recent BMI data.
