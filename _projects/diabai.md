  Diabetes is a chronic condition that requires continuous, comprehensive care. Our application, DiabAI, leverages machine learning to analyse patient data, incorporating the GenHealth.ai inference model to accurately predict health outcomes based on patients’ medical history. Additionally, the Perplexity model generates personalised care plans for both doctors and patients, supporting informed clinical decisions. DiabAI also presents patients’ FHIR data in a clear, accessible format. The app also displays charts of blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c, and creatinine levels, which are essential markers for diabetes management. DiabAI ensures an intuitive user experience with a user-friendly feature, such as tabbed navigation and minimalistic UI.
