description: >
  This system addresses the challenge of early Alzheimerâ€™s detection by providing clinicians with a tool to assess patient risk based on blood biomarkers. Early detection is crucial as it enables timely intervention, which can slow disease progression. This tool also empowers patients by providing insight into their health. Patients can upload blood test reports, either manually or via FHIR, and view risk assessments. Doctors will access patient data, apply risk models, and generate detailed reports to guide treatment.
