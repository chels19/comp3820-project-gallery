description: >
  The therapeutic level of a drug in the body is dependent on the individual. Too much is damaging, and too little does nothing. The proposed tool calculates the optimal dosing of Vancomycin using single compartment model. Patient details are needed, like height and weight. Other parameters include current dose, creatine level, measured drug concentration and bug sensitivity and target drug level. The model produces a 2-dimensional plot and recommendations.
