  The aim of this project would be to summarise the use of electronic notes utilising artificial intelligence modalities. This would help develop up to date, precise summaries of patients undergoing Rehabilitation to inform the programme the patient has undertaken while in hospital to the point of discharge. This incubator would help inform learning models to eventually summarise data at the point of patient referral to see if what requirements and parameters would be needed to aid their Rehabilitation journey.
