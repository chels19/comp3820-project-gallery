  The COPD management application is a SMART on FHIR app designed to enhance patient care by providing clinicians with a platform for managing patients with COPD. This application features interactive charts for heart rate, blood oxygen, and physical activity. It also includes patient questionnaire responses which calculate score, risks, recommendations, and AI generated personalised recommendations for improved care. Clinicians can share these results with patients via email or download a PDF with a patients assessment. This app revolutionises COPD management by integrating different tools to help patients manage their COPD resulting in better patient outcomes.
