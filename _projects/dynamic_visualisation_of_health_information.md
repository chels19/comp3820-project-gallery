  Our FHIR Visualization Tool provides a powerful, flexible solution for visualizing FHIR data, enabling healthcare professionals to interact with complex data more easily. It includes a text viewer as well as embedded resources viewers for PDFs, photos and JSON data. Data can be loaded from JSON directly, thru any URL with FHIR Bundle data or with one of the pre-embedded FHIR Server urls such as HAPI FHIR or SMART FHIR servers
