mentor: "Shaun Francis (RFDS Queensland)"
description: >
  Discover how our innovative FHIR-based application revolutionizes sepsis management by automating the retrieval of essential patient demographic data—such as age, sex, pregnancy status, and MRSA status—using LOINC codes. Integrated with the HAPI FHIR server, this tool replaces Queensland Health's paper-based triaging system to quickly identify patients at risk of sepsis. By providing real-time care and pharmaceutical recommendations based on accurate patient data, our app streamlines interventions and enhances patient outcomes.
