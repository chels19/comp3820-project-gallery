description: >
  The project aims to completely change the referral process of patients to the inpatient rehabilitation department through the digitization of handwritten medical records by doctors. By utilizing optical character recognition (OCR) technology and natural language processing (NLP), we will convert handwritten note images into structured, easy to understand PDF documents, using artificial intelligence to provide doctors with faster and more accurate decisions, and ensure timely care for patients.
